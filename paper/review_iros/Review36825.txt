Comments to the author
======================

This paper proposes a new method to reduce the computational time for
visual place recognition (VPR). This goal is achieved mainly due to 2
reasons. First, the database is significantly segmented to yield a
"represent subset". Second, they only considers a subset of query
sequence for matching. The method demonstrates a comparable accuracy to
SOTA methods, while its inference time is much faster than CoHoG.

STRENGTHS:
- The paper addresses a serious issue in VPR, i.e., scalability
- The proposed idea is interesting. It is reasonable to find and
discard redundancy in database and query, and spend more
effort on most "representative" information.
- The proposed idea is novel
- Experimental results show a great potential of the proposed idea.

WEAKNESSES:
- The introduction should be rewritten to make the motivation clearer,
e.g., why should we reduce the computation time? In this current
version, I couldn't see a clear motivation of reducing computation time
for VPR. Could [A] be a good reference for the paper's motivation?

-  The proposed idea is close to [B]. I could see the novelty between
the paper and [B], but it is nicer if the paper would discuss the
differences here such that the audience could see the a clear picture
in the field

- It will be nice if the paper would include the execution time of
other competitors to Fig 4

MINOR SUGGESTIONS (but it doesn't affect to my decision)
- I don't think "represent subset" is grammatically correct, how about
"representative subset"?

- In INTRODUCTION-"Moreover, the CNN’s encoding-time and runtime memory
are much higher than those required for the handcrafted descriptors".
It will be nice if there is a citation to support this claim

- Also, "Although the CNN-based VPR techniques have outperformed
handcrafted descriptor-based techniques currently, their intense
computational requirement is still a serious problem". It will be nice
if there is a citation to support this claim
